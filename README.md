# Project 1: Classification of Breast Cancer Cell Nucleii
**Objective:** Classify breast cancer cell nucleii samples as either benign or malignant
**Importance:** Benign and Malignant tumors are often treated using completely different methods. The treatments themselves can cause harm so using the incorrect treatment on a patient could not only be ineffective, but detrimental to the health of the patient.
**Skills Used:** Data Manipulation, Data Visualization, Classification with XGBoost, LightGB, and SVM 

# Project 2: Predicitive Maintenance Modeling

# Project 3: Data Collection and Parsing App
